# matrix-learning-tool

## Introduction
Our educational tool will be used to test students on their knowledge of the topic Matrices.
Through randomly generated mixed-practice quizzes, the tool will test the students on the
following sub-topics:

- Matrix addition
- Matrix subtraction
- Finding the determinants of a 2x2 or 3x3 matrix
- Matrix multiplication
- Finding the inverse of a 2x2 or 3x3 matrix
- Eigenvectors and eigenvalues of a 2x2 or 3x3 matrix.

Our tool also incorporates a revision notes feature, in the form of a formular sheet, for these subtopics which can allow students to go over the quiz content before and/or after attempting the quiz. For the quiz, the student can choose a difficulty between easy, medium, and hard. Each difficulty level contains pre-selected sub-topics for a set matrix size.For example, level easy includes addition, subtraction, multiplication, determinant, and inverse questions for 2x2 matrices.
The student can also select how many questions they want to attempt out of 5, 10, or 20. At the
end of the quiz, the questions they got correct and incorrect will be displayed along with the
correct solution. The user will be given an overall score depending on the number of correct
answers compared to the total number of questions. Students can re-attempt the quiz to receive a
differentset of random questions to test if they have improved. They will be able to view their
scores from past attemptsto track their progress by using the leader board feature of our tool.
This tool is aimed at A-levels students, those in college and undergraduate students. The tool will
give them the opportunity to improve their understanding of the topic of matrices. It can also
help students to identify their weakest sub-topics to focus their revision on. The revision pages
and the quiz can be used as a supplement for their revision.
